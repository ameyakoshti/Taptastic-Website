								<h2>Boxed Wholesale, Android</h2>
								<p>
									There’s an advantage to buying things in bulk: You don’t have to make return trips to pick up more for a long time. The problem is, wholesale stores aren’t always the most convenient places in the world to shop at. There’s often long lines, too many aisles to navigate, and annoying membership plans to deal with. Boxed Wholesale lets you score all of the benefits of visiting a big box store without actually having to step foot inside it. Buy huge orders of whatever you may need sent to your door in two business days. It’s like the Amazon of oversized packed goods.

								<h2>Edge: Quick Actions, Android</h2>
								<p>
									Do you ever feel like you don’t take full advantage of the screen on your smartphone? Like you’re just swiping aimlessly back and forth without ever actually going anywhere or accomplishing anything? You can make the entirety of your Android device’s screen act as a command center with Edges: Quick Actions. The app puts quick settings, useful toggles, and favorite apps in an easy-to-reach space by putting everything you may possibly need at your fingertips with a single touch. Just tap and a bar appears on screen, ready to launch any of your most used functions without you having to go look for them.

								<h2>Achvr, iOS</h2>
								<p>
									Your life is full of firsts. We usually think of things like first steps or first words or first day of school as the milestones that mark our lives, but you could have your very first experience of something any time. Your first time visiting a new place or meeting a certain person or seeing a particular band perform. These are all firsts and memories that you’ll want to hang on to. Achvr will help you experience tons of new things for the first time and will keep track of the experience for you so you never forget it.

								<h2>ToDoist update, iOS and Android</h2>
								<p>
									You have a lot on your plate any given day. You have tasks for work that you need to get done, some personal plans you’d like to get to, chores and errands that have probably been put off for too long. It can be hard to keep track of it all and easy to forget even the most important stuff. ToDoist, the popular task manager for iOS, just recently got a facelift to go along with new features to help you stay on task more than ever before. You can now sync all of your tasks in the background so they line up across every device you own.
